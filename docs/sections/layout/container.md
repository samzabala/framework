# Container

This div contains everything and padds contents away from edges. It also clearfixes chit for you This also has a set max width through [css variables](../setup/customize.md)

```html
<body>
	<div class="container">
		Hi I'm a shit
	</div>
</body>
```

If you want the container to not have a max-width, use **`.container-fluid`**


```html
<body>
	<div class="container-fluid">
		Hi I'm a shit. buT YOU CAN'T MAX ME OUT HAHAHAHAHAH
	</div>
</body>
```

That's it, that's all I have for this
